# AR Marker Detection and Tracking with C++

## Overview
This project focuses on the implementation of AR markers in C++ programming for augmented reality applications. AR markers are visual patterns used as reference points in the real world, allowing the overlay of virtual content onto the physical environment. The objective of this research project is to explore the effectiveness and practicality of utilizing AR markers in C++ to enhance the accuracy and stability of augmented reality experiences.

## Features
- Detection and tracking of AR markers in real-time.
- Integration of marker recognition capabilities into C++ AR applications.
- High performance and efficient memory management through C++ programming.
- Utilization of libraries and frameworks to optimize marker recognition.
- Evaluation of the system's reliability and precision under different environmental conditions.
- Accurate overlay of virtual content onto AR markers.

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang)
- [AR marker detection library]
- [AR marker tracking library]

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the necessary dependencies by following the instructions provided by the AR marker detection and tracking libraries.
3. Build the project using your preferred C++ compiler.
4. Execute the compiled application.
5. Follow the prompts or integrate the AR marker detection and tracking functionality into your own AR application.
6. Evaluate the system's performance and accuracy under various real-world conditions.
